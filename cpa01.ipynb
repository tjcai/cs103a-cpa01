In the mean time, there is a decline in Germany and United States' amount of cola consumption. This might be the result of China's role as world factory and its plans for boosting development of infrastructure. Besides, the annual coal consumption of Japan also increased steadly throughout those years, factors behind which are worthy exploring."

However, as time passed, there is an increasing trend in nuclear electricity.\n",
